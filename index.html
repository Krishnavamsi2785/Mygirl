Latika, October 11th will be exactly 1 year since we met. But I left many memories with you in this one year.Many times you asked me one thing, how you liked me. But I am also answering your question many times.

            <p>Your greatness, there are many reasons why I like you but I can't tell you. You are different from this society. A kind heart, a childish behaviour, that care,that love you shown on others,so many things are been there for loving you .If I abandon you in this life, there is no one more unfortunate than me on this earth.</p>

            <p>I will always tell you one thing. I will love you till the end. It doesn't matter how many people say anything.Even as you say, I will continue to do it till the end, but I will not tell outside and will not trouble you.
            
            Because of my love is true.</p>
            <p>Any how take care Thalli.&hearts;.</p>
